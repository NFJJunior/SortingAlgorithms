# SortingAlgorithms
 
 I implements 4 sorting algorithms: MergeSort, TimSort, RadixSort, ShellSort.
 I recorded the sort times in the tests.txt file.

 The maximum number of elements in an array is 1e8 and the maximum value of an element is 1e9.

 N is the number of elements of the array, Max is the maximum value of an element from the array.
 The program receives from keyboard N and Max and returns the sort times of every sorting algorithm.
